# Python-MessengerWall

The Messenger Wall is simplified version of facebook app exploring One to Many Relationships.   After a User passes several login form validations designed using Logic, Bcrypt, and password Hashing and Salting, they enter a dashboard in session where they can send and receive messages to/from all the users in the MySQL Database.  Basic Four loop logic is applied for creating message displays and Users being both Senders and Receivers are set up as foreign keys in MySQL.
